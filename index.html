        <h1>Jelly Light</h1>
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p class="paragraph-margin">
                This is a final project created for CPSC 599.88 (Tangible & Physical HCI).  Students were tasked with creating a wearable 
                TUI that is inspired by hygge, the Scandinavian concept of coziness and its associated connotations.   In response to this,  
                I reflected on my own definition of hygge and created a jellyfish shaped reading light intended to be used when reading before 
                going to bed.  This design of this light takes into account the fact that hygge moments cannot last forever, and 
                gently reminds the user that their reading time is limited.      
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph-margin">
                The jelly light is a mixture of a timed reading light and a scarf.  Users are able to set the amount of time they would like to
                read, and the jelly light will glow with white light, decreasing the intensity proportionally to the amount of time remaining.
                When the light turns off, users know that their reading time is up.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The jelly light consists of an Arduino Mega, its associated circuitry, and a crochet embodiment.  All electrical components are
                encapsulated within the crochet embodiment, and several electrical components were augmented with conductive thread to further 
                integrate the electrical and crochet elements.

            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <p>
                The jelly light allows the user to select the amount of time they would like to read for.  Once the user uses gives the bookmark
                to the jellyfish, it will glow with an intensity proportional to the amount of time the user has left to read. At this point, users 
                can either put the jelly light on or leave it on their desk.  After this time
                has elapsed, the light shuts off.  At this point, it is time for bed.  The user can place an eye mask on the jelly light, and it will
                cycle through various RGB colours for a set amount of time as the user sleeps.  After this time has elapsed, it is time for the user to wake up.
                The jelly light turns off the RGB light and slowly increases the intensity of a white light, in hopes of waking the user up.

                The embodiment of the jelly light is primarily crochet.  I designed this pattern to be large enough to house
                an Arduino Mega, while being cozy enough to wear.
